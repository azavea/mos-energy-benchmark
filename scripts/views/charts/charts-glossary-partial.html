One BTU is the amount of energy required to raise one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit. Portfolio Manager automatically converts kilowatt hour to Btu. </p> </div> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="label">District Steam Use (kBtu)</div> <p> Annual district steam consumption for the property as reported from utility bills. </p> </div> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="label">Electricity Use (kBtu)</div> <p> Annual electricity consumption for the property from the grid (reported from utility bills) plus the total amount energy produced from onsite solar panels or wind turbines (if applicable). </p> </div> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="label">ENERGY STAR Score</div> <p> The 1-100 ENERGY STAR score was developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and provides a metric for comparison with other similar buildings across the country. The score accounts for differences in climate, occupancy and operating hours. A score of 50 represents median energy performance, while a score of 75 or better indicates a building is a top performer. </p> </div> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="label">Energy Use Intensity (EUI)</div> <p> The metric used for comparing buildings in Portfolio Manager, EUI expresses a building’s energy use relative to its size. It is expressed as kBtu/ft², and is calculated by taking the total energy consumed in a year (kBtu) and divided by the floor area of the building (ft²). </p> </div> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="label">Fuel Oil #2 Use (kBtu)</div> <p> Annual heating oil consumption for the property as reported from utility bills. </p> </div> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="label">Natural Gas Use (kBtu)</div> <p> Annual natural gas consumption for the property as reported from utility bills. </p> </div> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="label">Notes</div> <p> Additional information on building provided by building owners or operators. </p> </div> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="label">Number of Buildings</div> <p> The total number of buildings that are located on a multi-building property. </p> </div> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="label">OPA Number</div> <p> Tax parcel ID number for the property.
