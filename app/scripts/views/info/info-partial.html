            <h4>About this tool</h4>
            <p>This visualization tool provides building-level energy performance data for the 2013, 2014, and 2015 calendar years for the nearly 2,000 properties required to report utility information as part of Philadelphia’s energy benchmarking law. You can learn more about energy benchmarking and read the Year Two Benchmarking Report at <a href="http://www.phila.gov/benchmarking" target="_blank">www.phila.gov/benchmarking</a>.</p>

            <h4>Building Energy Performance</h4>
            <p>Building energy performance is a critical metric for cities dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In Philadelphia, more than 60 percent of citywide greenhouse gas emissions stem from building energy use. As part of the City’s <a href="#" target="_blank">Greenworks sustainability plan</a>, Philadelphia set a goal to reduce emissions 20 percent by 2015. Improving building performance will help Philadelphia reach that goal, and benchmarking provides building owners with the information they need to begin making informed decisions about upgrading and investing in energy efficiency (see <a href="#" target="_blank">this page</a> for existing resources to invest in your facility).</p>
