BuildingEnergyBenchmarking
==========================

This [project](https://azavea.github.io/mos-energy-benchmark/ "Energy Benchmarking") is hosted by github. For development, just run `serve.sh` and head on over to port 8080 on localhost.

### Developing

Dependencies:
```
# TODO: Add vagrant vm
sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-dev
sudo gem install sass compass
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Then to serve the dev server:
```
grunt serve
```

The dev app will be served at localhost:9000 and automatically opened in a new tab in your default browser.

The app will auto refresh after saving js/css/html
